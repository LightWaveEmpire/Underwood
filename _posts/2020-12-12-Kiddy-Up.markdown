Kiddy-Up is an application that assists parents in building and managing the child's routine by collecting pertinent scheduling information from multiple online sources and presenting the information to each child at a grade-appropriate level. 

Kiddy-Up application focuses on taking third party calander API's or utilizing the built in calander to import and parces events. These events are parced to either user accounts or to precreated sub children accounts, SpaCy uses natural language processing to parces and handle event duplications and collisions. 

Events will then be displayed using preselected age comprehension levels to display events in age approaprate interfaces. In addition to basic interface customization, users can create impliment a rewards system for one or all sub children accounts. 

Kiddy-Up repository can be acccessed at [GitHub][1]. The following is a walkthrough of the basic use and functionality of Kiddy-Up
